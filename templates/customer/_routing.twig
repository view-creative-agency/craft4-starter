{#
	Some Entry Types have their own fields and therefore also their own template. If so, load the right template.
	If the current entry is an Entry Type that does not, fall back to the default template.

	There's some potential weirdness in Craft4 now we have Conditional Fields, but it may be better to stick to
	this approach because it's more compatible with Eager Loading - you know what fields to grab ahead of time.
